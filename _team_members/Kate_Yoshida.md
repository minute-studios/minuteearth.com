Kate rides horses into the sunset in the US southwest. She has a Ph.D. in hyenas and takes care of a menagerie of animals, including a Griffin. Unsurprisingly, she is responsible for many of our animal-themed videos, and she also has a hand in most everything else as an editor, director, and herder of cats, trying to keep the rest of us on schedule.
