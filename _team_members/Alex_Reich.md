Alex is a man of many hats at MinuteEarth – he writes, edits, Facebooks, Tweets, and crunches data for us. He also wears a lot of actual hats, since he lives in chilly Minnesota and has spent serious time traveling the Arctic. Even his stick figure sports a hat! And if there were a hat for sustainability, he’d wear it - he’s our go-to guy for all things food, and agriculture, and climate change.
