Nathaniel's colorful voice is in every single MinuteEarth video. You'll hear it as guitar and bass strings vibrating along with other musical - and magical - sounds. He does music for MinutePhysics too, so if you have been around on Youtube for a while, you have probably listened to his tracks at some point.
