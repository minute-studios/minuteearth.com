Ever is a math lover at heart; before joining MinuteEarth he was a math teacher and gets carried away with any video that has math references or math in fancy after effects animations. He’s also our resident translations, internet culture, and cuteness expert (being Venezuelan helps with at least one of these). When he’s not working on MinuteEarth – and maybe sometimes while he is – he spends his time thinking about pokemon, playing Zelda, making platonic solids and hyperbolic surfaces in origami, eating baby food, and watching Game of Thrones.
