Peter is MinuteEarth’s green thumb – he even grew two members of the MinuteEarth team! And after watching Henry blossom from a creator of Lord of the Rings spoofs (circa 2005) into a creator of excellent science videos (circa 2011), Peter had the germ of an idea for a more Earth-focused version of MinutePhysics. That idea grew roots and eventually sprouted into MinuteEarth. Today, when he’s not overseeing massive experiments at the University of Minnesota, Peter digs into his vast expertise and harvests video ideas on forest ecology and global change.
