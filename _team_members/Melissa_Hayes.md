Melissa has a thing for bees. Her family runs a bee farm. She likes to make art out of layers of their wax. Even her daughter is named Bea (ok, Beatrice). So when it comes to MinuteEarth, itâ€™s no surprise that the park ranger-turned-lawyer also minds all of our beeswax. By managing our legal and business affairs, she turns our swarm of chaos into a thriving hive.
