The next time you're wandering in the woods in the American Northeast, look out for Sarah, who gains inspiration by spending her time staring at - and sketching - the trees. In addition to being a natural history illustrator, Sarah's also a photographer, folk harpist, calligraphist, and whatever-new-crafts-she-can-get-her-hands-on-ist. And late at night, when it's too dark to enjoy branches and leaves outdoors, you'll probably find her watching old school Vines.
