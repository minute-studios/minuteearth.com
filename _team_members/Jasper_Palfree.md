When he's not swing dancing or mountain biking, Jasper runs [MinuteLabs][ml], the web home for all of MinuteEarth's and MinutePhysics' interactive projects. How does Jasper manage to do everything? Easy - his creations are powered by JavaScript, and his frenetic pace is powered by (annoyingly good) coffee.
