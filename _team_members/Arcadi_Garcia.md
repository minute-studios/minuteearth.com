Somewhere in the Mediterranean night, Arcadi is awake, spreading joy and science through his [Spanish-language YouTube channel][ttp] and [podcast][podcast]. Or maybe he’s cooking or playing video games. Or rewatching RuPaul’s Drag Race. Or maybe he’s being very silly on late-night Spanish Twitter. Or - most likely - he’s attempting to insert yet another deep cut pop culture Easter Egg into the latest MinuteEarth video he’s illustrating.
