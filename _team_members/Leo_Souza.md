Born and raised in Brazil, Leo has always had a passion for making science interesting and accessible - that's how he got started making the Portuguese version of MinuteEarth, Minuto da Terra. From there, heâ€™s helped to launch multiple other language versions of MinuteEarth, along with creating all sorts of short MinuteEarth content. When he is not translating, recording and editing, you can find him doing other interesting stuff like talking to plants, cooking or enjoying the outdoors - anywhere in the world. Tchau!
