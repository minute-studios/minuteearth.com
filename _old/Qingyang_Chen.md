Qingyang’s background as an awesome medical illustrator makes her our in-house expert whenever we’re making a video about, say, organ transplants or brain injuries. But if it were up to her, every video we make would be about cats. In particular, they would be about the cross-Toronto adventures of her cat Waffles, the most telegenic feline on the entire internet.
