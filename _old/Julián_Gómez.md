Born in Argentina and raised in Nerdfighteria, Julián is MinuteEarth’s resident futurist: he’s even got a whole [YouTube channel][fn] about it. And while he’d love to discuss the impacts of new technology with you, he’d prefer to do that while also exploring a new area (and ferreting out its rarest Pokémon).
