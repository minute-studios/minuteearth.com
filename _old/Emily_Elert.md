There aren’t many literary geologists out there, but Emily is a rare gem. After years of teaching earth science to New York City high schoolers and digging up dirt for magazines like Discover and Popular Science, Emily brought her passion for understanding and explaining the forces of the planet to our channel. Emily’s not just a writer - she also produces, directs, and narrates videos. In other words, you’re looking at MinuteEarth’s own rock star.
